/**
 * Shared button primitive (EPOCH-203 / VER-10).
 *
 * Extracted from the button treatments already duplicated across the app:
 *   - accent   -- the primary-CTA fill used for "Prepare evidence",
 *                 "Run forensic analysis on N backups", "View investigation",
 *                 "Install with Homebrew", the password-modal "Continue".
 *   - outline  -- the surface-raised secondary treatment used for "Change",
 *                 "Check again", "Choose destination"/"Change destination".
 *   - ghost    -- the bare-text tertiary treatment used for the advanced-
 *                 settings disclosure toggle (no background, no padding,
 *                 color-only hover). Deliberately does NOT also cover
 *                 "Try again" (accent-colored, underlines on hover) or the
 *                 "Select all" / "Select none" segmented pill toggle in
 *                 WorkspaceView.tsx -- both read as distinct controls (a
 *                 link and a compound segmented control, respectively)
 *                 rather than restatements of this variant, and forcing
 *                 them through the same API would blur that difference.
 *                 Left for a follow-up pass; see VER-10 ticket comment.
 *   - danger   -- new. No shared destructive-button treatment existed
 *                 anywhere in the app prior to this ticket. Built on the
 *                 existing `--danger` token using the same solid-fill rule
 *                 `accent` already follows (colored bg + the `--background`
 *                 token for text, since both `--accent` and `--danger` sit
 *                 at a similar mid-high HSL lightness and need the same
 *                 dark-text contrast fix).
 *
 * `tone="danger"` (only meaningful on `variant="outline"`) resolves what
 * were two independent flat-border, hover-reveals-danger patterns in the
 * app (DevicePullPanel.tsx's "Try Homebrew instead" fallback, and
 * WorkspaceView.tsx's EPOCH-305 Cancel button) into one elevation-based
 * treatment, per DESIGN.md §1: a border on a button-shaped control is "the
 * wrong tool -- use elevation." Both call sites are migrated onto this
 * rather than kept as their own one-off border styling. Not a 5th variant
 * enum value -- it only changes `outline`'s hover color, same elevation
 * shape either way.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT built on Radix `Slot`/`asChild` composition -- `Badge.tsx`
 * already established a plain `cva`-only variant pattern for this app, and
 * EPOCH-201's ordering note (VER-8) asks this ticket to reuse whatever
 * pattern governs `Badge.tsx` rather than inventing a second one. If a
 * future ticket needs a button that renders as a link, that's an additive
 * `asChild` prop on this file later, not a rewrite.
 *
 * Loading state renders `Loader` (see ./Loader.tsx) inheriting
 * `currentColor` rather than taking a color prop. Every existing spinner in
 * the app (`border-background`, `border-flag`, `border-accent` variants) was
 * already just matching whatever text color surrounded it -- this component
 * sets that text color per `variant`, so the spinner needs no color of its
 * own to stay in sync.
