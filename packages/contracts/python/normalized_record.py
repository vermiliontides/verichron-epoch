"""
Pydantic mirror of normalized-record.schema.json -- the record SHAPE only.

SourceType is NOT defined here. It's owned by source_type.py (see that
file's own docstring). This module imports it so
`from normalized_record import NormalizedRecord, SourceType` keeps working
unchanged for every existing caller -- the import is what makes this
module's SourceType and source_type.SourceType the same object, not two
independently-defined enums that happen to agree.

Requires Python 3.12+ (see source_type.py for the StrEnum rationale).
