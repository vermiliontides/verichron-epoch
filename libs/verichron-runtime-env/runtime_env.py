Lives under libs/ rather than inside any single application (packages/etl-db-writer,
an extractor, etc.) because it doesn't parse forensic artifacts or execute a
workflow -- it enforces a system-level guardrail (.venv existence) that
applies to any Python process in the monorepo, migrate.py and extractors
alike. Locking it inside one package would mean either duplicating it or
having unrelated applications reach into each other's directories.
