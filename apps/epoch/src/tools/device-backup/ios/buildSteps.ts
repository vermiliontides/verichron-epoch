/**
 * Real build sequence, sourced from libimobiledevice/libimobiledevice's own
 * README (fetched directly, not guessed) plus its Debian/Ubuntu dependency
 * list. Building the full chain from source -- not relying on distro
 * packages for libplist/libusbmuxd/libimobiledevice-glue/libtatsu -- is
 * deliberate: distro package versions lag, and the whole point of this
 * path is getting current iOS/device compatibility, which is exactly what
 * stale distro-packaged versions can't guarantee.
 *
 * Dependency order matters and is fixed: libplist and libimobiledevice-glue
 * have no dependency on each other and could build in either order, but
 * libusbmuxd depends on libplist, libtatsu depends on nothing else in this
 * chain, and libimobiledevice depends on all four. Listed in an order that
 * satisfies all of that.
 *
 * Everything installs to `installPrefix` (an app-owned directory, not
 * /usr/local) specifically so this never needs sudo/pkexec/administrator
 * elevation -- only the one apt/brew step below (real system packages,
 * genuinely can't be redirected to a user prefix) needs that, and it's
 * handled separately as an install-instructions action the user runs once,
 * not part of this automated sequence.
