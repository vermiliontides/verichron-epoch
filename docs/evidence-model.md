# Evidence model

How Verichron Epoch identifies evidence, what it derives from it, and how a fact
stays traceable to its source. The components named here are described in
[architecture.md](architecture.md).

## Evidence

**Evidence is identified by its content, not its location (R6).** The processor
hashes every file of a backup into a *canonical manifest*:

- one line per file: `<sha256>  <path>`;
- paths are relative, NFC-normalized and `/`-separated;
- lines are sorted by the path's UTF-8 bytes.

The evidence's `content_root` is the sha256 of that manifest. The same backup
mounted at two paths, or on two machines, is one piece of evidence with two
*locations*. Renaming a file inside the backup changes the identity; moving the
whole backup does not. Byte-identical files from two devices are still two
pieces of evidence: nothing is deduplicated across evidence.

The manifest is stored content-addressed (`manifests/<root>.sha256`) and never
overwritten. The sidecar pointing at it is replaced atomically, and only once
its manifest exists, so a crash can never leave a sidecar naming a missing
manifest.

**Devices.** A device is keyed by `HMAC-SHA256(UDID, per-install secret)`, with
a user-editable label. The raw UDID is never stored, so the same phone matches
across backups without its identifier leaking into the database, the UI or
reports. The secret lives in `~/.config/verichron/device-key.secret` (mode 0600;
a copy other users can read is refused). The UDID is read from `Info.plist`'s
`Unique Identifier` / `Target Identifier`; `GUID` is an iTunes backup ID, not the
UDID, and is refused.

## Derivatives

A *derivative* is something produced from evidence: the **decrypted** backup,
and two made from it, whose parent is the decrypt: the **mvt results** checked
from it, and **iLEAPP's output** (`ileapp_output`). Facts are filed under the
derivative they were read from, so iLEAPP records belong to iLEAPP's output, not
to the decrypt (R7).

A derivative's identity is **(evidence, kind, parent, provenance)**:

- **provenance** is the tool that made it and the parameters that shaped it, for
  example:
  - a decrypt records the mvt-ios version and the SQLite repair outcome (sqlite3
    version, databases repaired, files not fully recovered, originals kept as
    `.corrupt-<timestamp>`);
  - a results set records the mvt-ios version and the hash of the IOC set it
    was checked against;
  - iLEAPP's output records the iLEAPP commit (the submodule's, because
    iLEAPP's self-reported version does not match its release tag) and how
    iLEAPP read the decrypt (`itunes` or `fs`);
- `provenance_key` is the sha256 of that provenance in canonical form;
- a different tool version, repair outcome, IOC set or iLEAPP commit is
  therefore a **new derivative**. A derivative's provenance is never rewritten; only its path, its
  last-known location, is updated.

**Completion markers.** The processor writes `.mvt_decrypted_ok`, `.mvt_check_ok`
and `.ileapp_ok` only once a derivative is finished. Each records the evidence `content_root` it
was made from and its provenance. Registration refuses a derivative whose marker
is missing, malformed, or names different evidence. That's how a backup that
changed under the same label can never have its old decrypt filed under the new
evidence.

**IOC sets.** The processor runs mvt-ios only against IOC files it manages. Each run
checks against a private copy of them, and the hash of that copy is what the
results record, so a refresh during a run can't change what was recorded.

## Runs

A *run* is one invocation of the pipeline over one piece of evidence. **A run is
an audit event; facts belong to evidence, not to runs (R7).**

- Every rerun creates a new run; finished runs are never reopened.
- Each stage's row records its status, times, the parser version it ran at and
  the derivative it read.
- **Completeness has one definition (R23):** the `run_completeness` view. A run
  is `running` until it finishes; `incomplete` if any stage failed or was left
  pending or running; otherwise `complete`. A `skipped` (disabled) stage never
  makes a run incomplete. Nothing else may re-derive this.
- **Resume.** Evidence is skipped only if a complete run already ran every stage
  enabled now, at the parser version declared now, against the derivative it
  would read now. A parser version bump, a newly enabled stage, a new results
  set or new iLEAPP output therefore gets a new run.

## Facts and the ledger

Every fact enters through one door, `ingest()` in `db_writer.py` (R13).

- **The unit is one source file:** `(evidence, file_hash, source_type,
  parser_version)` (R6). A file's ledger row, payload and records commit together
  or not at all (R13, R14). A failed unit leaves no trace, so the next run
  retries it.
- **Identity comes from context (R16).** The orchestrator passes evidence,
  derivative, run and parser version, and the writer stamps them. A stage never
  supplies them.
- **Each unit declares its payload** (R12): `full`, `summary` or `none`.
- **Versions are append-only (R8).** Bumping a stage's `parserVersion` re-ingests
  each file as a new unit beside the old one.

Reads go through two views (R27):

| View | Shows |
|---|---|
| `current_forensic_records` | Completed units only, at each file's latest completed parser version. An unfinished re-parse never hides finished facts |
| `forensic_records_history` | Every completed unit at every version, opt-in |

The report and the desktop app both read these views, so they can't disagree.

## Time

Timestamps are UTC and timezone-aware, or null; a time is never guessed (R11).
A plausible but wrong date is worse than none, so ambiguous numeric timestamps
are rejected rather than interpreted (EPOCH-419). Records without a time are
counted and shown, never dropped.

## What is not modelled yet

| Gap | Ticket |
|---|---|
| Database-level immutability of completed facts, and one audited purge procedure | EPOCH-412 |
| LLM findings versioned by model and prompt (today they dedup across models) | EPOCH-426 |
| Facts from a superseded results set or iLEAPP output still read as current | EPOCH-428 |
