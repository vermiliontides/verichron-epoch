# Verichron Epoch

Verichron Epoch is a forensic workbench for iOS devices. It takes an encrypted
iTunes/Finder backup, decrypts and verifies it, runs extractors and indicator
(IOC) matching over it, and produces a report an examiner can defend: every fact
is traceable to the exact evidence, tool version and IOC set that produced it.

It behaves like a careful lab technician, not a scanner: it never loses,
misattributes or over-claims evidence, and it always says what it did not do.

> **Status:** pre-release. The first target is an air-gapped **Lab build**
> ([decision](docs/decisions.md#product-and-builds)). Open work is tracked in
> Linear (project prefix `EPOCH-`).

## How it fits together

```
device / backup ──► mvt-runner ──► orchestrator ──► stages ──► PostgreSQL ──► report, desktop app
                    hash, decrypt,   register evidence,  extract,
                    repair, IOC scan run stages in order  write facts
```
