"""
Diagnose why apps/extractors/ileapp_bridge/iLEAPP's PluginLoader discovers
zero plugins even though scripts/artifacts/ contains hundreds of real
plugin .py files (confirmed: 384 files present in a real smoketest run).

Reproduces what ileapp.py does at module-discovery time, one step at a
time, so a silent failure shows up directly instead of as an unexplained
empty list. Does not assume the cause -- prints what actually happens at
each step and lets you read the result.

Usage:
