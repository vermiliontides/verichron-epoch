"""
Tests for ETLRunResult (extractors/etl_run.py).

The behavior under test is the one EXTRACTOR_CONTRACT.md section 5 is built
around: partial progress survives AND the stage still exits non-zero. Those two
requirements pull against each other, and the failure mode when they are
conflated is a stage that loses data and reports success — so the exit-code
rules get direct assertions rather than being implied by an integration test.
