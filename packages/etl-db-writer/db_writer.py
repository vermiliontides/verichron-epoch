"""
extractors/db_writer.py
 
Shared Postgres write helpers every Python extractor imports. This is the
concrete thing that makes the extractor contract's idempotency and
validation requirements load-bearing instead of aspirational — an
extractor author doesn't hand-write ingest/write SQL and hope it matches
the contract, they call these functions.
 
Owns exactly what the two shared tables need:
  - ingest()      -> a transaction that covers the ingested_files row AND the
                     forensic_records rows for one file, or neither. Units are
                     evidence-scoped (EPOCH-402): see IngestContext.
  - write_record() / write_records() -> validated insert into forensic_records
 
Deliberately does NOT own:
  - source-format parsing (each extractor's own code)
  - the `fields` sub-shape (each extractor owns and documents its own, per
    EXTRACTOR_CONTRACT.md #4)
 
Why `ingest()` is a context manager and not the old `ingest_file()`
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The previous API was two independent calls, each of which committed:
 
    file_hash, already = ingest_file(conn, ...)   # committed here
    if already: return
    records = parse(...)                          # <-- anything failing here
    write_records(conn, run_id, file_hash, records)   # committed here
 
and dedup was keyed on the ledger row merely existing:
 
    SELECT 1 FROM ingested_files WHERE file_hash = %s
    if found: skip this file entirely
 
Those two facts combine into permanent silent data loss. If anything went
wrong between the two commits, the ledger claimed the file was ingested while
none of its records existed, and every later run skipped it — reporting
success — forever. In a chain-of-custody tool, evidence disappeared and
nothing said so.
 
That was not a rare interruption case. All three extractors hit it on their
ordinary error paths: crash/main.py `continue`s when parse_ips_file fails,
mvt_iocs `return`s when alerts.json won't parse, ileapp_bridge `return`s when
every record in an artifact fails to normalize — each after ingest_file() had
already committed the ledger row.
 
The fix is structural rather than a rule to follow. `ingest()` owns the
transaction: the ledger row, the raw payload, the records, and the completion
flag all commit together or roll back together. There is no exposed call that
commits a ledger row on its own, so a caller cannot reconstruct the old
sequence by accident. `write_record`/`write_records` no longer commit at all
(they are also used inside a unit), which is what the caller-owns-the-boundary
change asks for and incidentally stops `write_record` from paying a commit per
row.
 
A future TypeScript extractor uses packages-ts/etl-db-writer/dbWriter.ts, which
mirrors this file's semantics with a callback in place of the context
manager. It used to live under packages-ts/orchestrator/src/ alongside a
now-deleted, never-imported IngestionOrchestrator class; moving it kept the
one real thing in that directory and dropped the dead one, rather than
implying the orchestrator itself depends on it (it never did — see
main-orchestrator/main.ts, which writes nothing to Postgres directly and
only spawns the Python extractors that do).

            else:
                unit.write(records)

    A unit is identified by (evidence_id, file_hash, source_type,
    parser_version) (R6, R8): the same bytes under two evidence items are two
    units, and a parser_version bump is a new unit beside the old one.

    `file_hash` is the file's sha256, unless the unit is one part of a file:
    then the caller passes `content_hash`, a sha256 over that part's content,
    and names the part in `file_path` (e.g. `_lava_artifacts.db#safarihistory`
    for one iLEAPP artifact table, EPOCH-461).

    Guarantees:

    - On clean exit the ledger row is marked complete with its record count and
      everything commits together.
    - On any exception the whole unit rolls back, including the ledger row, so
      the file has no trace in the ledger and the NEXT run retries it.
    - `already_ingested` is True only when a previous run marked the unit
      complete — never merely because a row exists.
    - Every attempt that ends cleanly, fresh or dedup hit, adds ctx.run_id to
      produced_by_runs. A completed unit's other columns are never rewritten.
    - An abandoned unit from an earlier crash (row present, not complete) is
      reclaimed: its orphaned records are deleted and it is re-ingested, so a
      retry cannot double-count a partial write.

    Concurrency: the upsert below locks the ledger row for the duration of the
    transaction, so two extractors racing on the same unit serialize instead of
    both deciding to write.
