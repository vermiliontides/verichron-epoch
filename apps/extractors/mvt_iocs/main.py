Consumes mvt-ios's OWN analysis output as primary evidence:

  - results/<name>/alerts.json   -> source_type: mvt_ioc_detection
  - results/<name>/timeline.csv  -> source_type: timestamp_anomaly

This is the one extractor in the pipeline that deliberately does NOT
re-parse a raw artifact out of the decrypted backup (contrast with
safari/sms/network, which parse History.db/sms.db/DataUsage.sqlite
directly — see EXTRACTOR_CONTRACT.md and ./README.md "Why this extractor
doesn't follow Option A"). alerts.json IS the primary evidence for a
detection — mvt's own judgment that something matched an indicator or
heuristic is not a second-hand parse of something more authoritative;
there is no more-primary source to prefer instead. timeline.csv is mvt's
own already-built cross-module index, reused here rather than re-derived,
per the same reasoning.

Two source_types, two different questions:
  mvt_ioc_detection  — "what did mvt itself flag?" (one row per alerts.json
                        entry, timed or not — untimed alerts, e.g. a global
                        preference flag, are still stored; they just can't
                        participate in the report's correlation window)
  timestamp_anomaly  — "is there anything ACROSS EVERY MODULE whose own
                        timestamp is impossible given when this backup was
                        taken?" — a check no individual mvt module performs,
                        because each module only validates its own record
                        shape, never plausibility against the backup itself.

See ./README.md for the fields sub-shape, the FORWARD_LOOKING_PLUGINS
exclusion rationale, and partial-failure behavior.
