"""
A real-Postgres counterpart to PgDouble, for running the same tests twice.

TEST SUPPORT ONLY. Nothing in production code imports this outside tests.

Why both
--------
PgDouble's own docstring lists what a SQLite double cannot prove: JSONB and
TIMESTAMPTZ semantics, Postgres CHECK and FK behaviour, real locking. The
answer is not a second, always-Postgres test file -- two copies of the same
assertions drift apart the same way the double and the migration can. Instead
`db_fixture()` parametrizes a suite's existing `db` fixture over both backends,
so every test body runs against both and a divergence between them shows up
as one backend failing (R33).

What this wrapper adds over a bare psycopg2 connection
------------------------------------------------------
Only what the shared test bodies already call on PgDouble:

  - `commits` / `rollbacks` counters, for the "exactly one commit" assertions
  - `ledger()`, `records()`, `record_count()` assertion helpers, returning rows
    in the same shape PgDouble does (JSONB columns as JSON text), so an
    assertion like `"EXC_CRASH" in row["raw_payload"]` means the same thing on
    both backends instead of silently becoming a dict-key check here

Everything else -- cursors, execute_values, the writers' SQL -- is genuine
psycopg2 against a genuine server.

Safety
------
Each test starts by TRUNCATE-ing the pipeline tables. The URL therefore comes
from TEST_DATABASE_URL only, never DATABASE_URL, so a developer whose .env
points DATABASE_URL at a dev database with real evidence in it cannot wipe it
by running pytest. Migrations must already be applied (CI runs migrate.py
first); this module does not create schema.
