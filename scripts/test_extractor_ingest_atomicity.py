"""
Regression tests for the extractors' error paths.

The review filed this as an interruption race — "if the process dies between the
two commits". Investigating it turned up something worse: all three extractors
reached the bad state on their *ordinary* error paths, no interruption required.

  crash/main.py            committed the ledger row, then `continue`d when
                           parse_ips_file() returned an error
  mvt_iocs.process_alerts  committed the ledger row, then `return`ed when
                           alerts.json would not parse
  ileapp_bridge
    .process_artifact_file committed the ledger row, then `return`ed when every
                           record in the artifact failed to normalize

In each case the file was then permanently skipped by every later run and
counted as a success. A malformed artifact — the single most likely thing to
appear in a real forensic backup — was enough to trigger it.

These tests drive each extractor's real error path against a transactional
database double and assert that the file is left retryable. They are the reason
the fix changed the extractors and not just db_writer.py.
