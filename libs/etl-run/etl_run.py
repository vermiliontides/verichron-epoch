libs/etl-run/etl_run.py

Shared per-item result tracking for extractor main() entrypoints.

Every extractor's stage loop follows the same shape (EXTRACTOR_CONTRACT.md
#5): walk a list of source items — files, alerts, rows, whatever the
extractor's natural unit of partial failure is — and for each one either
produce a complete written record or contribute nothing. One bad item is
isolated and logged, not silently swallowed and not allowed to abort the
rest of the run.

Extractors with more than one independently-failable input (e.g.
extractors/mvt_iocs/ processing alerts.json and timeline.csv separately,
per EXTRACTOR_CONTRACT.md #5's multi-input rule) build one ETLRunResult
per input and combine them with merge() before deciding the stage's exit
code — one missing/malformed input still doesn't block the other.

`fail()`, `ok()`, and `note()` all return `self`, so a caller can either
chain (`ETLRunResult().ok(5)`) or call them as plain statements across a
loop — both styles are used across the extractors.

    `succeeded`/`failed` count whatever unit the extractor treats as its

    should call ok() once per item, not once per row, so the printed
    summary answers "how many things did I process" rather than "how many
    rows exist," which is what a reader actually wants after a run.

    `failures` stores structured `(item_label, reason)` pairs rather than
    pre-joined strings. `fail()` renders `BaseException` arguments as
