LLM-assisted triage over MVT check-backup output, plus differential
tamper-detection across two backup snapshots.

Checkpointing is per-CHUNK (not per-file) in SQLite, so:
  - Resuming after an interruption only re-does chunks that never completed
    successfully (status 'pending' or 'failed') — chunks already marked
    'safe' or 'flagged' are never re-analyzed.
  - A file is only considered complete when every one of its chunks reached
    a terminal, non-failed state. A run where every chunk failed (e.g.
    Ollama was down) leaves the file incomplete and eligible for resume,
    instead of being silently marked done.
  - Failures are bounded-retried per chunk, not infinitely re-attempted and
    not silently swallowed into the results.

Each chunk also records which model produced its result (model_name).
This matters because a chunk's "safe"/"flagged" verdict is a judgment
call, not a deterministic fact — switching the analysis model mid-project
without tracking that would silently produce a report with unlabeled,
inconsistent-provenance findings. See stale_model_chunk_counts /
reset_stale_model_chunks / --remodel below for how that's surfaced and
fixed, rather than papered over.

Chunk analysis runs concurrently (--max-concurrent) via a thread pool, but
deliberately keeps all SQLite writes on the single main-thread connection:
worker threads only ever do the network round-trip to Ollama (query_local_llm),
and record_chunk_result is only ever called from the main thread's
as_completed() loop in process_file(). sqlite3 connections aren't safe to
share across threads, so this split — not a connection-per-thread scheme —
is what makes concurrency safe here without adding locking.
