# crash stage

Parses iOS `.ips` crash and analytics files into `crash_report` facts, one per
file. Order 10; it reads the **decrypted backup**. It follows the
[stage contract](../../../packages/contracts/EXTRACTOR_CONTRACT.md).

> **Open question (EPOCH-447):** the stage collects `*.ips` files from the
> decrypted backup (`rglob("*.ips")`). An iTunes/Finder backup stores files under
> hashed names without extensions, and probably holds no crash logs at all. If
> that's confirmed, this stage finds nothing on real backups until crash reports
> get their own source.

## Parsing

`parse_ips_file` reads both `.ips` shapes: a metadata line followed by a JSON
body, or a single JSON document. `extract_rich_telemetry` pulls out the useful
fields. The whole parsed document is kept as the payload (`full`).

Top-level columns:

- `incident_id`
- `event_time`, from `captureTime` or `date`; null if unparseable
- `bug_type`, `process_name`, `pid`, `bundle_id`

`fields` holds the rest:

```json
{
  "filename": "...", "os_version": "...", "hardware_model": "...", "cpu_type": "...",
  "bundle_version": "...", "parent_proc": "...", "parent_pid": 1, "proc_launch": "...",
  "proc_path": "...", "proc_role": "...", "time_awake_since_boot": 5000,
  "exception": { "type": "...", "signal": "...", "code": "...", "subcode": "..." },
  "termination": { "namespace": "...", "code": 6, "by": "..." },
  "faulting_thread": 0, "is_simulated": false, "is_non_fatal": false,
  "asi": ["..."], "vm_region_info": "..."
}
```

The field mapping was worked out from real samples. Apple publishes no format
spec, so a new iOS version may leave some fields null rather than raise an error.

Failures are handled per file: an unparseable file is rolled back and retried on
the next run, while the others commit. The atomicity tests are in
`scripts/test_extractor_ingest_atomicity.py`.
