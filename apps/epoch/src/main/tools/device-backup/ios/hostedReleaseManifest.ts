 * Manifest shape for a "download our own verified release" flow, similar

 * users at unverified third-party mirrors.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: `releaseUrl` below is a placeholder, not a real, working
 * download. Standing up the actual release -- compiling libimobiledevice
 * for each platform in CI, publishing it somewhere, generating real
 * checksums -- is a separate infrastructure task (a build/sign/publish
 * pipeline) that doesn't exist yet. This manifest is the *consumer* side:
 * once a real release exists at a real URL with real checksums, updating
 * this file is the only change needed here. Nothing in
 * hostedReleaseAcquisition.ts should be changed to make that work.
