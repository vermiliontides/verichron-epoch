"""
Transaction-boundary tests for extractors/db_writer.py.

The bug under test, stated precisely: `ingest_file()` committed the
`ingested_files` ledger row, `write_records()` committed the file's
`forensic_records` in a separate transaction, and dedup was keyed on the ledger
row merely existing. So any failure between the two commits produced a ledger
row with zero records, and every later run saw the row, declared the file
already ingested, counted it a success, and never wrote its records. Evidence
vanished from a chain-of-custody database and nothing reported an error.

These tests run the real `ingest()` code against a SQLite double with real
transactions (see libs/testing/testing/pg_double.py) and assert the outcome by
querying the database, rather than asserting that commit() was called in a
particular order. The distinction matters: the old code called commit() exactly
when its author intended, and was still wrong.
